Version: 2.5
Author: Lei Wang
Maintainer: Lei Wang <devradiumking@outlook.com>
Description: This package offers both individualized comparison of protein groups (Venn Diagram and Target Diagram) and pairwise label-free quantitation of chemical probe-modified peptides from the MaxQuant database search output.    
    It generates datasets containing tiered intersections of protein groups for Target Diagram; p-values and fold change information for volcano plots.
